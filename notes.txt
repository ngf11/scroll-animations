One way to add add animation on scroll by using this new css feture @scroll-timeline
Is a new css is @ rule similar to a media query
It intigrates with animation timeline from the web animations API

This asllows you apply css animations where the position of the scroll-bar
But this is not supported by any browsers

What we can use is intersection observer.

to bring in the intersection observer.
we need to identify an elemet in the DOM we want to observer.
this will be a lot easer with a frame work.
But with vanilla JS we can give each element a class.
class= "hidden"

if your go to your JS and grab them all byt using document.qurryselectorAll()

The next step is to creat the intersection observer.

This is a class that takes a callBack function in its constrator
the cool thing about is that can observer multiple elements or enteries at the same time. This function will run once the vesability of an observe elements changes.

Because it handels multiple enteries we need to use a foreach loop over them. then we can run a simple conditional check console.log() to see if that entry is intersection a point or not 
if it is intersecting we wil add a class name "show"
if you want to show the animation once you can stop here.
you will also wan to re move the class "show"

const elementHidden = document.querySelectorAll(".hidden");
const observer = new IntersectionObserver((enteries)=>{
    enteries.forEach((entry)=>{
        console.log(entry)
        if(entry.isIntersecting){
            entry.target.classList.add('show')
        }else{
            entry.target.classList.remove('show')
        }
    })
})

Now that we have the observer.
we need to tell it what to observe

elementHidden.forEach((el) => observer.observe(el));
